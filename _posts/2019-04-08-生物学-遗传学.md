### 2. Chromosomes: 

![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/9kYhROB.jpg)Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis

1. Heterochromotin: Densely compacted regions where most of the selfish elements are located, usually around centromeres.
2. Euchromatin: Loosely compacted regions where most of the active genes are located
3. Centromeres: The region of the chromosome where spindle fibers attach. Satellite DNA (lowly complexed repeat sequences) are usually located in the heterochromatic regions flanking centromeres.

4. Nucleolar organizers: Nucleolus contain ribosomal RNA. Nucleolar organizers are located within nucleolus and contain the genes that code for ribosomal RNA, which are usually in tandam repeats (~200 copies) to make sure the large amount of rRNA in the cell. ![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/okRhres.jpg)Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis
5. Tolemers: The ends of chromosomes. Usually the ends of chromosomes are hard to replicate but this problem is solved by the fact that tolemers contain tandem short DNA repeats.
6. Histones: Histones are highly alkaline proteins that are highly conserved across eukaryotes. Histones package DNA into nucleosomes. There are fine families of histones: H2A, H2B, H3, H4 and H1/H5. H2A, H2B, H3, H4 are the core histones that form octamers (two units of each) to wrap DNA. H1/H5 are linker histones that link and further package nucleosomes. ![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/7L3lO5f.jpg)Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis
7. Genome sizes: ![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/llnH5c2.png)Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis

### 3. Mitosis and meiosis

![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/xmwDDi5.jpg)Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis
	
1. spindle fibers (microtubule): polymers of the protein called tububin. 
2. kinetochore: A disc-shaped protein complex attached to the centromeres of duplicated chromatids and the spindle fibers so to pull chromatids apart during cell division. Tubulins depolymerize at the kinetochores to shorten the spindle fibers thus to pull apart the sister chromatids. ![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/ArzXBnX.jpg) ![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/urnedIZ.jpg) Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis

### 4. Recombination

1. Crossing-over occurs atthe four-chromotid (tetrads) stage ![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/JEqt14n.jpg)Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis


### 5. Genetcis of bacteria and bacteriaphage

1. Horizontal gene transfer: Transformation, conjugation, transduction ![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis] (https://i.imgur.com/EKxx6Hg.jpg)Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis
2. F factor: A small circular plasmid that allows cell to donate genetic material. 
3. Conjugation: F plasmid in F+ cells synthesizes pilus to make a contact with F- cells. Then the F DNA make a single-strand copy of itself by rolling circle replication mechanism to the F- cells, converting F- cells into F+ cells. ![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis] (https://i.imgur.com/d3O1Deh.jpg)
4. Hfr strains: strains where F plamsid integrated into chromosome. This allows the transferring of genomic DNA form the donor to the recepient. ![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis] (https://i.imgur.com/2GiDrTM.jpg)Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis
5. Transformation: ![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/mMUUaO2.jpg)
6. Transduction: 
	1. Random transduction: Phages incorporate random host DNA fragment and transduce to other bacteria ![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/5ZmOoL0.jpg) 
	2. Specialized transduction: Phages insert into bacterial chromosome at specific location and only transduce DNA that are nearby. Phage lamda is a good example (mechanism not shown here). 

	
### 6. From genotype to phenotype

![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/tEjq3gL.jpg)
 
1. Epistasis: One mutation at one loucs can overide a mutation at another locus in a double mutant. This is different from dominance as dominance refers to two allels at the same gene locus. 

### 7. Transposable elements

1. Transposons in prokaryotes:

1. Insertion-sequence (IS) elements in bacteria: phage lamda inserts next to the gal operon in E. coli. Several E. coli gal- mutants were found to contain large insertions of DNA into the gal operon and many different insertion mutations are caused by a small set of insertion sequences instead of ramdom sequences. 

2. Two types of bacterial transposons: composite transposons (two inverted repeats IS elements flanking a gene and IS elements encodes transposase) and simple transposons (short IR sequences flanking transposase gene and other genes)

![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/yovE3BY.jpg)


3. Prokaryotic transposition from plasmid to to host: Conservative trasnposition (transposons do not replicate) and replicative transposition (transposons replicate)

![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/ps20Fai.jpg)

2. Transposons in eukaryotes

1. Dr. MxClinktock's experiment in maize: the Ds element (activated by Ac element which encodes transposase)

![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/qzcjDAt.jpg)

2. Two major types of transposons: RNA transposon (retrotransposon) and DNA transposon. Retrotransposons are predominantly abundant in eukaryotic genomes. The first transposon Ds identified from maize is a DNA transposon.

3. Transposons in human

![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/muIq1QD.jpg)

Remarkebaly: a specific SINE called Alu (~200bp) has more than 1 million copies in human genome which makes up more than 10 percent of the whole genome.

![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/MQgdRXj.jpg)

4. Safe havens for successful transposons: non-coding regions, other transposons, and expecially centric heterochromotin where there are virtually devoid of genes but have many repetative sequences. Nearly 70% of yeast genome are introns but yeast genome harbors hundreds of copies of Ty elements. This is because Ty elements can insert into only specific locations in genome. For example, Ty3 elements only insert to regions near tRNA genes. R1 and R2 elements are both LINES in arthropods and only insert into rRNA gene clusters.

5. Certain transposons evolved to be the essential part of host genomes: Tolemerase

### 9. Large-scale chromosome mutations

![Griffiths et al., An Introduction to Genetic Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/WTTORHi.jpg) 

Variations in chromosome numbers:

1. Monoploids: Monoploids are very rare in higher eukaryotes. Exceptions include wasps, ants and male bees. This is because monoploid zygotes or germ cells cannot go through meiosis due to the lack of pairing chromosomes, thus causing sterility. Wasps, ants and male bees produce gamets by mitosis instead of meiosis. 

2. Polyploids: Common in plants but rare in animals. Usually the higher the number of chromosome copies, the larger the size of cells or organisms. 

Variations in chromosome structure:
