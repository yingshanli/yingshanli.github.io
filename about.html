    <p>Hello, welcome to my website! I'm Yingshan Li, a Ph. D candidate in the Biological Sciences Department, University of Nebraska, Lincoln. I study molecular genetics and bioinformatics, mostly using unicellular algae Chlamydomonas as the model. I started to be fascinated by the life sciences since I was in high school. From a mechanical perspective, life is just amazing. Even a tiny cell is much more complicated than the most complex machine in the world. We, humans, are far from completely understanding life and are, of course, having a hard time in reverse-engineering even the simplest life in the world. Life is difficult but not impossible to study. In the past half-century, life sciences have made significant progress, featured by the advances in molecular biology. I like doing researches in the lab to hopefully help contribute to a better understanding of basic biology, both through computational approaches and wet experiments.</p>

    <p>The most often thing I do with my spare time is reading, writing, and learning new things. High-throughput sequencing of genetic materials, along with the advances in supercomputing in the past 10-20 years have profoundly revolutionized biology research. Good research in biology nowadays tends to be multidisciplinary and requires integrated expertise and knowledge. Abilities in data mining and data management have now become essential in many areas. To avoid being too scatterbrained, I have been focused on only computational techniques rather than spending too much time on understanding and developing mathematical models and algorithms. All in all, I aspire to be a good scientist in biology and a good technician in computer science. 
	
	<p>I built my website initially with the purpose to keep a record of my learnings and thinking. I like writing, both technical articles, and assays involving more intellectual thinking. I figure that writing is one of the best ways to help me really comprehend information and put everything together. Most importantly, writing is THE most effective way to communicate with other people in the world, not only during one's lifetime but also afterlife.</p>
		
	<p>In real life, I‚Äôm not good at socializing. I particularly like hiking in the mountains. I wonder if it is partly because of the character ‚ÄúShan‚Äù in my name which means Mountain. I‚Äôve visited quite some famous mountains, such as The Yellow Mountain, The Huashan Mountain, the Rocky Mountain, Mountain Taishan, Lushan, etc. Notably, That‚Äôs pretty much all about me. I hope you can benefit from reading my blogs and I welcome any forms of communication with me!</p>
