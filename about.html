    <p>Hello, I'm Yingshan Li, a Ph. D student in Biological Sciences Department, University of Nebraska, Lincoln. I study molecular genetics and bioinformatics, mostly using unicellular algae Chlamydomonas as the model. I was fascinated by life sciences since I was in high school. The accuracy and complexity as well as the elegance of mechanisms that lives obtain has always been amazing to me. I like doing researches in lab, both through computational approaches and wet experiments.</p>

    <p>The most often thing I do with my spare time is reading and writing. I have broad interests in natural science and philosophy, not just biology. Ultimately the universe and life are physical and chemical. Knowing more about physics and chemistry is essential for understanding life. Computer science is also rather appealing to me. Well, maybe not computer science but computational techniques. I'm not very fascinated in developing new fancy algorithms but I like utilizing current computer technologies to help me solve biological problems.</p>
	
	<p>I built my own website initially with the purpose to keep record of my learnings and thinking. I like writing, both technical articles and assays involing more originality. I figure that writing is one of the best ways to really comprehend knowledges and organize one's thinking. Most importanly, writing is THE most effective way to communicate with world, not only during one's lifetime but also after death.</p>
		
	<p>Unfortunately, I‚Äôm not quite a social guy. It‚Äôs always a difficult task for me to approach strange people. Other than reading and writing, I also like watching movies. Good movies, in my opinion, gather a great deal of good thoughts and tell some good stories in the most succinct way. Hiking is another major hobby of mine. I particularly like hiking in mountains. I wonder if its partly because of the character ‚ÄúShan‚Äù in my name which means Mountain. I‚Äôve visited quite a lot famous mountains, such as The Yellow Mountain, The Huashan Mountain, the Rocky Mountain, Mountain Taishan, Lushan, etc. Notably, I have just visited a variety of mountains in Tibet, including The Everest Mountain. I camped on foot of The Everest which is over 16,000 feet high but I didn‚Äôt climb to the top though. That‚Äôs pretty much all about me. I hope you can benefit from reading my blogs!</p>
